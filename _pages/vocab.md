# APCSA Vocab

- Objects have **attributes** which are characteristics of an object
- A **class** is the blueprint that **objects** are created from. **Instantiating** an object calls the constrcutor to create an object.
- A **constructor** is code that has the same name as the class and tells the computer how to create a new object 

- **Parameter**: a variable in the method/constructor signature that defines the type of value to receive when the method or constructor is called
    - in the definition of a function
- **Argument**: a value passed to a method/constructor when the method or constructor is called
    - when calling the function
