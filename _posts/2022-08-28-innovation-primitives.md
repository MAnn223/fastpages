# Innovation - Primitives (Week 1)

## Code.org Lessons 1-5

## Primitives Hacks
> Create a Jupyter Notebook(s) using IJava kernel and that you could use it to capture key learning on Primitives.

## Bash Checks
> Create a Jupyter Notebook using Bash and that you could use it to show that you have all the key tools installed.   This should also be a Blog for your own personal memory.

## College Board Learning
> Each student captures information  in Fastpages thinking ... how they are going to capture information that will grow to 10 college board units ... how they will recognize something as PBL vs College Board.

## Fastpages Hacks
> Add _pages/notes.md or _pages/vocab.md, insert between tags.md and about.md. Use this area to capture idea and terms throughout the year.
- [vocab]()
>Consider using your home page for other subjects other than Computer Science. The searching and tagging features are very powerful and could help recall.
