# Week 4
- [Issue on Github](https://github.com/MAnn223/fastpages/issues/6)

## FRQ 
> During the year we want to learn the four types of FRQs. This week we want to focus on the first type.

- FRQ No. 1: Methods and control structures (Focus)
- Pick question type 01 from one of the years posted on the former EXAM page. Solve the problem, including missing pieces in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Make this a quality blog. My suggestion is Pairs do different FRQs and crossovers do the same, to make grading more valuable.
- Browse through multiple questions, find a question that may be somewhat like a PBL interest.

## Java Spring Backend/Thymeleaf 
> Using creativity and research, can you come up with something that alters Hello, World application. Perhaps a calculation, like counting words or letters in a phrase.
