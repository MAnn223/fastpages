    "The correct answer was `(int) (Math.random() * myList.size())` but I answered `Math.random (myList.size())`.  Since Math.random() doesn't take any parameters, this will result in an error. With the right answer, the random function will generate a random number between 0 and 1, nt including 1. Then this value is multiplied by the number of elements wanted in the size of myList. Since the randomly generated floating point is typecast to an `int`, the result is an integer value between 0 and 1 less than the list size."

Since the superclass, `Book`, has a `length()` method, there will be no compile time error and at run-time, the subclass `AudioBook`'s `length()` method would be executed. The right answer is Line 4 will not compile since `books` array has been initialized as a type `Book` so can't call the subclass `AudioBook` methods."

    "[\"bear\", \"zebra\", \"bass\", \"cat\", \"koala\", \"baboon\"]` because the manipulate method contains a for loop with a loop control variable k that starts at the right most index of animals, decrements by 1 each time, until k is equal to 0. In the first iteration, when k is 5, if the element of animals at 5 (“baboon”) starts with a “b”, which it does, **then this value is removed from the list and inserted at index 1**. The list would then be {“bear”, “baboon”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”}. In the second iteration, when k is 4, the element of animals at 4 (“cat”) does not start with a “b” and **no changes are made to the list**. In the third iteration, when k is 3, the element of animals at 3 (“bass”) starts with a “b”. This value is removed from the list and inserted at index 3. Since it was already at index 3, the list would not change. In the fourth iteration, when k is 2, the element of animals at 2 (“zebra”) does not start with a “b” and no changes are made to the list.  In the fifth iteration, when k is 1, the element of animals at 1 (“baboon”) starts with a “b”. **It is removed from the list and inserted at index 5**. *The list would then be {“bear”, “zebra”, “bass”, “cat”, “koala”, “baboon”}.*  Finally, k decrements to 0 which is not greater than 0 so the loop terminates."
